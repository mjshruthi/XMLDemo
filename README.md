Trying to create new repository and push code from local
it worked, but not sure how - I tried the push master - got error message that email privacy setting, is not allowing push
Went and changed email privacy setting and tried push master.
It worked.
Time to experiment more.

trying to fetch to get the changes made in remote - didn't work.
Got rejected - fast forward message
After few tries, pull with question mark worked and updated loacl with changes made on Remote

We get the Push or commit - rejected - fast forward message
when there are changes somewhere on the remote.

Before the first commit and push, I created a repository and changed the password.
So, might be one of the reasons - the commit was rejected - saying fast forward.

some more changes to verify, what can hel p pull these canges to local.
